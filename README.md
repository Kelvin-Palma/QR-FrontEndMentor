Very easy project for someone who recently start in the web development! The only issue I had was the height of the footer.

### Useful resources

- [Dev Docs](:https://devdocs.io/css/box-shadow) - This helped me to remenber how to put the shadow, and i think it is very important to use these libraries to solving certain problems.
